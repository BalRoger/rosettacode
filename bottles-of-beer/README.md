** Basic Solution **
With a closure to handle special cardinalities of bottles.
    src/basic.groovy

** Single Print Version **
Uses a single print algorithm for all four lines. Handles cardinality on bottles, uses 'No more' instead of 0.
    src/single.groovy

** Bottomless Beer Solution **
Using more closures to create a richer lyrical experience.
    src/bottomless.groovy
